# Spam Email Detection 📧

This repository contains a mini project developed in the 2nd year of our B.Tech program, built by **Tarang Verma**, **Saurabh Kumar Yadav**, and **Harsh Kumar**. The goal of this project is to identify and classify emails as spam or not spam using machine learning techniques.

The repository includes the complete implementation in Python, Jupyter Notebook, dataset, research documentation, project report, and a presentation.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Spam emails are a major concern in digital communication. Our model uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to detect spam with high accuracy. We’ve used vectorization and classification methods to train and test the model on real-world data.
